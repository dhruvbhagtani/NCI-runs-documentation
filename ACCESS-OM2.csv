025deg_jra55_ryf_nostress,"Ryan's configuration experiment - we use the switch zero_surface_stress_except_BL = True to zero surface wind stress contribution in the momentum equations. However, we found that the zero winds was somehow propagated to mixing layer depth formulation too.",Deleting
025deg_jra55_ryf_nostress_cont,Ryan's configuration experiment - we use the switch zero_surface_stress_except_BL = False. Typical control run.,Deleting
025deg_jra55_ryf_nostress_param_kpp,"A no wind stress experiment with resolved shear parameterisation to make the KPP formulation ""feel"" the effect of winds.",Archiving
025deg_jra55_ryf_param_kpp3,"The successful control experiment (hence the name 3, representing the number of attempts) where we were able to get the best resolved shear formulation for KPP depth estimation. This is used in all future experiments as our control experiment. Here, the switch dVsq_param is set to True in ocean_vert_kpp_mom4p1 namelist. The default coefficient list is listed in input.nml.",Archiving
025deg_jra55_ryf_param_kpp_extended2,An extension of 025deg_jra55_ryf_param_kpp3 experiment which outputs high frequency (3 hourly) forcing for MOM5 experiments. The simulation begins at year 100 of 025deg_jra55_ryf_param_kpp3.,Archiving
025deg_jra55_ryf_stress_NH,A perturbation experiment where winds are only present in Northern Hemisphere.,Deleting after proper outputs

025deg_jra55_ryf_vary_rlds20_SAT3.75,A perturbation experiment where we vary the longwave radiation by +20W/m2 and also vary the SAT by 3.75 degrees (the numbers are inspired from Maurice's perturbation experiments) to understand the effect of heat on ocean gyres. These experiments weren't successful as the longwave radiation gradually returend back to their original position.,Deleting
1deg_jra55_ryf_control,"Ryan's configuration experiment - we use the switch zero_surface_stress_except_BL = False. Typical control run, but at 1 degree resolution. Also, we don't have any resolved shear parameterisation for boundary layer depth.",Deleting
